<b>ChaCha20-Poly1305 Implementation</b>
</br> In this repo I have implemented chacha20-poly1305. I have used IETF RFC 7539 as reference for implemention.

</br></br><b>To-do:</b>
<ul>Separate the unit test from the chacha20-poly1305.js</ul>
<ul>Make the chach20-poly1305.js exportable</ul>
<ul>Optimize the code</ul>
